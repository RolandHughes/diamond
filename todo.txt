*) look at ExtraSelection logic around line 706 in diamond_edit.cpp. May have to
*do some of that with edt.
*) Test EOL in actual EDT. See if doesn't advance line when hit repeatedly  EOL
*navigates up/down at end/begining of line depending on EDT direction.
*) Test OPEN LINE in actual EDT to see what it really does. - OPEN LINE inserts
*a line break at cursor position keeping cursor there but moving text down to
*next line against left margin.
*) Test out FILL in real EDT to see what it really does - I think help text says
*"not implemented"
*) Add support for EDT keypad
*) get EDT changes hooked into Undo - need to emit undoAvailable() to activate
*on main menu. Need to research how that really works.
*) need to emit copy available? Using mw_cut() so probably not.
*) Remove unused signals from diamond_edit.h
*) Need EDT command dialog
*) Fix macro save - make it actually happen - test create-use-save-reload of macros
*) test out macro save/load/use. I really butchered that.

*) debug regular expression to C/C++ definition for numeric constant

*) file selector called by File->Open needs to allow for hidden files.
   File feature request with CopperSpice

*) File->new should NOT whack the first tab


*) add support for EDT commands
    S|some-text|new-text|sel   wh  rest
    INC file.name =buff-name
    INC file.name
    WRITE   (log into Eisner and verify WRITE options)
    EXIT
    QUIT
    See what other EDT and LSE commands are worth adding.
    LINE 9999
    Really like GOLD= for "goto line"
    See what else is worth saving from Emacs EDT.
    Probably GOLD-C for copy?

*) COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, and most other large installed base languages DO NOT support
 // or /* */ for comments. That part of Syntax Highlighting must be moved to the
 patters. For COBOL a comment is * in column 7 when using 72-column CARD format
 or as the first character in a line when using "free" format. Pick up a copy of
 "The Minimum You Need to Know to Be an OpenVMS Application Developer" to learn
 more about other languages.


*) Should not be nuking/skipping empty tab at startup if there is any file name in the list.
*) File->New should not be whacking the current file tab, it should create a new
 tab




*) Read up on Doxyprint to see if it mimics Doxygen comments.
    If it is like Doxygen,

*) read documentation for QSyntaxHighlighter in CopperSpice
   see if there is any support for "matching" {(<
   if so add option to turn on "matching" highlight
