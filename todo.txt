*) Look at first time run sequence for a Diamond install. There was some kind of dialog about creating a new default config file or a custom location.
   Appears to only happen on Windows. Have to test there.

*) test turning spellcheck on in big text document.

*) EDT keys don't seem to work in split window/frame

*) Need to be able to show FF character. It gets inserted, but does not show.  This will require gutting QPlainTextEdit I think. Need to see how it shows spaces and tabs.

*) Fix macro save - make it actually happen - test create-use-save-reload of macros
    from menu_action.cpp
    m_textEdit->macroStart();
    m_textEdit->macroStop();
        // save macro to global list
        m_macroList = m_textEdit->get_MacroKeyList();
    Global list should now be in Settings. Only the global list should be saved and loaded.
    EDT keys might need some work to be part of macro.

*) test out macro save/load/use. I really butchered that.

*) Find all of the TODO:: comments and clean them up. Now that we have startup stages for main window many of the tightly coupled things can be done in stage2 or stage3
*) debug regular expression to C/C++ definition for numeric constant


*) File->new should NOT whack the first tab
*) File->New should not be whacking the current file tab, it should always create a new tab even if there is an empty tab.

*) add support for EDT commands
    S|some-text|new-text|sel   wh  rest
    INC file.name =buff-name
    INC file.name
    WRITE file.name [range] | ALL | SELECT
    EXIT
    QUIT
    See what other EDT and LSE commands are worth adding.
    LINE 9999
    SUBSTITUTE   /QUERY   WHOLE | REST | BEFORE | SELECTION

*) COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, and most other large installed base languages DO NOT support
 // or /* */ for comments. That part of Syntax Highlighting must be moved to the
 patters. For COBOL a comment is * in column 7 when using 72-column CARD format
 or as the first character in a line when using "free" format. Pick up a copy of
 "The Minimum You Need to Know to Be an OpenVMS Application Developer" to learn
 more about other languages.

*) It would be nice to support a user supplied tab stop list so the editor could support COBOL, FORTRAN, and several other
   languages. Old FORTRAN had very specific column for comment start. ANSI COBOL starts AREA-B in column 8 with the
   continuation/comment indicator in column 7. Columns 73-80 are additinoal ignored comments.

*) read documentation for QSyntaxHighlighter in CopperSpice
   see if there is any support for "matching" {(<
   if so add option to turn on "matching" highlight
    ~/Downloads/qq31-parenthesis.zip  source code for QtQuarterly31.pdf shows how to do parentesis matching. Should be able to expand for handle <> [] {} as well as ()

*) search online for matching brace logic

*) Get ^M substitution working for EDT search. The problem isn't the substitution. The problem is the "blocks" in QPlainTextEdit. The new line character isn't in the actual text. Have to write a custom search that looks for a block starting with everything after ^M and then checks the end of the preceeding block to see that it matches.
