*) Need dialogs for copy/delete theme buttons
    If deleted theme is current theme change to "Classic" theme. "Classic" theme
    cannot be deleted.
    Rename "Default" theme to "Classic"

*) Load needs to actually load the new fields.

*) Add importOldColors() to be called if JSON tags found for old colors.
    It creates a theme called User-1 and makes it active.
    Since we no longer update/overwrite old stuff won't be saved again.

*) Fix current line highlight to only change background

*) Insert DiamondTextEdit on colors dialog so we can see actual color changes
*for gutter, etc. Load sample.cpp from resource file.

*) empty/hidden (other) tabs not updated on theme change. background color is
 still old color.

*) find regex for PREPROCESS and VARIABLE-n in notepadqq. Add to Diamond

*) steal theme colors from notepadqq

*) create EDT Help dialog

*) have changeSettings() slot in DiamondTextEdit repaint everything if theme changed.

*) find out why changing a theme causes multiple calls to create key definitions?

tab spacing needs to change?






*) Add copyTheme() dialog to prompt for new theme name and create a new entry in
*theme map. Set the displayed/selected theme in dialog to new theme


*) Read up on Doxyprint to see if it mimics Doxygen comments.
    If it is like Doxygen,

*) add support for EDT direction lock

*) add support for EDT commands
    S|some-text|new-text|sel   wh  rest
    INC file.name =buff-name
    INC file.name
    WRITE   (log into Eisner and verify WRITE options)
    EXIT
    QUIT
    See what other EDT and LSE commands are worth adding.
    LINE 9999
    Really like GOLD= for "goto line"
    See what else is worth saving from Emacs EDT.
    Probably GOLD-C for copy?

*) research regular expression for string of numbers.
    add to each of the syn_xxxx.json files
    add support for new JSON class in Syntax::processSyntax()

*) read documentation for QSyntaxHighlighter in CopperSpice
   see if there is any support for "matching" {(<
   if so add option to turn on "matching" highlight

*) Split settings into 2 classes
    one class contains stuff needed by DiamondTextEdit
    Other contains recent file/folder and other lists only used in MainWindow
