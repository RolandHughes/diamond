*) <Ctrl>-C in EDT mode needs to perform edtCopy

*) DELETE key needs to turn off EDT select. Actually anything that falls through needs to turn off EDT select.

*) Advanced Find, doublclicking entry needs to set focus on DiamondTextEdit, not remain on the line

*) Need EDT command dialog

*) test turning spellcheck on in big text document.

*) update EDT Help text to talk about what actually got implemented and how Apple/MAC users will be screwed when it comes to using select and arrow keys because their arrow keys are considered part of the keypad.

*) FILL not implemented  *** rewrapParagraph() is on the context menu

*) Need to be able to show FF character. It gets inserted, but does not show.  This will require gutting QPlainTextEdit I think. Need to see how it shows spaces and tabs.

*) Fix macro save - make it actually happen - test create-use-save-reload of macros
*) test out macro save/load/use. I really butchered that.

*) Find all of the TODO:: comments and clean them up. Now that we have startup stages for main window many of the tightly coupled things can be done in stage2 or stage3
*) debug regular expression to C/C++ definition for numeric constant


*) File->new should NOT whack the first tab
*) File->New should not be whacking the current file tab, it should create a new
 tab
*) Should not be nuking/skipping empty tab at startup if there is any file name in the list.


*) add support for EDT commands
    S|some-text|new-text|sel   wh  rest
    INC file.name =buff-name
    INC file.name
    WRITE   (log into Eisner and verify WRITE options)
    EXIT
    QUIT
    See what other EDT and LSE commands are worth adding.
    LINE 9999

*) COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, and most other large installed base languages DO NOT support
 // or /* */ for comments. That part of Syntax Highlighting must be moved to the
 patters. For COBOL a comment is * in column 7 when using 72-column CARD format
 or as the first character in a line when using "free" format. Pick up a copy of
 "The Minimum You Need to Know to Be an OpenVMS Application Developer" to learn
 more about other languages.



*) read documentation for QSyntaxHighlighter in CopperSpice
   see if there is any support for "matching" {(<
   if so add option to turn on "matching" highlight

*) search online for matching brace logic

*) Get ^M substitution working for EDT search. The problem isn't the substitution. The problem is the "blocks" in QPlainTextEdit. The new line character isn't in the actual text. Have to write a custom search that looks for a block starting with everything after ^M and then checks the end of the preceeding block to see that it matches.
