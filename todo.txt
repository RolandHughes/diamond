*) debug regular expression to C/C++ definition for numeric constant

*) file selector called by File->Open needs to allow for hidden files.
   File feature request with CopperSpice

*) Add support for EDT keypad
*) create EDT Help dialog
*) Need EDT command dialog

*) Debug syntax slowness - try preloading syntax
*) Find a way to make syntax highlighting faster. Too much lag between "broadcasting settings" and screen update with multi-thousand line files.


*) find out why connecting a settings signal from dialog_colors to current tab causes crash. I suspect my dynamic_cast<> failed for some reason and the connect() statement didn't complain about a null.









*) Should not be nuking/skipping empty tab at startup if there is any file name in the list.
*) File->New should not be whacking the current file tab, it should create a new
 tab
 
*) test out macro save/load/use. I really butchered that.







*) Read up on Doxyprint to see if it mimics Doxygen comments.
    If it is like Doxygen,

*) add support for EDT direction lock

*) add support for EDT commands
    S|some-text|new-text|sel   wh  rest
    INC file.name =buff-name
    INC file.name
    WRITE   (log into Eisner and verify WRITE options)
    EXIT
    QUIT
    See what other EDT and LSE commands are worth adding.
    LINE 9999
    Really like GOLD= for "goto line"
    See what else is worth saving from Emacs EDT.
    Probably GOLD-C for copy?

*) research regular expression for string of numbers.
    add to each of the syn_xxxx.json files
    add support for new JSON class in Syntax::processSyntax()

*) read documentation for QSyntaxHighlighter in CopperSpice
   see if there is any support for "matching" {(<
   if so add option to turn on "matching" highlight
