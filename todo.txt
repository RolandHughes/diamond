*) Remove unused signals from diamond_edit.h

*) update EDT Help text to talk about what actually got implemented and how Apple/MAC users will be screwed when it comes to using select and arrow keys because their arrow keys are considered part of the keypad.

*) Need EDT command dialog

*) Clicking on file tab needs to immediately shift focus to text edit once displayed.

*) FILL not implemented

*) Need to be able to show FF character. It gets inserted, but does not show.

*) DELETE key needs to turn off EDT select. Actually anything that falls through needs to turn off EDT select.

*) Test OPEN LINE in actual EDT to see what it really does. - OPEN LINE inserts
*a line break at cursor position keeping cursor there but moving text down to
*next line against left margin.


*) Fix macro save - make it actually happen - test create-use-save-reload of macros
*) test out macro save/load/use. I really butchered that.

*) debug regular expression to C/C++ definition for numeric constant

*) file selector called by File->Open needs to allow for hidden files.
   File feature request with CopperSpice

*) File->new should NOT whack the first tab
*) File->New should not be whacking the current file tab, it should create a new
 tab


*) add support for EDT commands
    S|some-text|new-text|sel   wh  rest
    INC file.name =buff-name
    INC file.name
    WRITE   (log into Eisner and verify WRITE options)
    EXIT
    QUIT
    See what other EDT and LSE commands are worth adding.
    LINE 9999

*) Read up on CPPCheck and see if it can do things like syntax specific auto-indent

*) COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, and most other large installed base languages DO NOT support
 // or /* */ for comments. That part of Syntax Highlighting must be moved to the
 patters. For COBOL a comment is * in column 7 when using 72-column CARD format
 or as the first character in a line when using "free" format. Pick up a copy of
 "The Minimum You Need to Know to Be an OpenVMS Application Developer" to learn
 more about other languages.


*) Should not be nuking/skipping empty tab at startup if there is any file name in the list.

*) read documentation for QSyntaxHighlighter in CopperSpice
   see if there is any support for "matching" {(<
   if so add option to turn on "matching" highlight

*) search online for matching brace logic

*) Get ^M substitution working for EDT search. The problem isn't the substitution. The problem is the "blocks" in QPlainTextEdit. The new line character isn't in the actual text. Have to write a custom search that looks for a block starting with everything after ^M and then checks the end of the preceeding block to see that it matches.
