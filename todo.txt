*) Add support for EDT keypad
*) create EDT Help dialog
*) Need EDT command dialog
*) add support for EDT direction lock

*) debug regular expression to C/C++ definition for numeric constant

*) file selector called by File->Open needs to allow for hidden files.
   File feature request with CopperSpice

*) File->new should NOT whack the first tab


*) add support for EDT commands
    S|some-text|new-text|sel   wh  rest
    INC file.name =buff-name
    INC file.name
    WRITE   (log into Eisner and verify WRITE options)
    EXIT
    QUIT
    See what other EDT and LSE commands are worth adding.
    LINE 9999
    Really like GOLD= for "goto line"
    See what else is worth saving from Emacs EDT.
    Probably GOLD-C for copy?

*) COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, and most other large installed base languages DO NOT support
 // or /* */ for comments. That part of Syntax Highlighting must be moved to the
 patters. For COBOL a comment is * in column 7 when using 72-column CARD format
 or as the first character in a line when using "free" format. Pick up a copy of
 "The Minimum You Need to Know to Be an OpenVMS Application Developer" to learn
 more about other languages.







*) Should not be nuking/skipping empty tab at startup if there is any file name in the list.
*) File->New should not be whacking the current file tab, it should create a new
 tab
 
*) test out macro save/load/use. I really butchered that.


*) Read up on Doxyprint to see if it mimics Doxygen comments.
    If it is like Doxygen,

*) read documentation for QSyntaxHighlighter in CopperSpice
   see if there is any support for "matching" {(<
   if so add option to turn on "matching" highlight
