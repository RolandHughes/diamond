<p>EDT Keypad navigation is from a time before keyboards had arrow keys let alone PageUp/Down keys. DEC software engineers made efficient use of the numeric keypad that was added for data entry users. Instead of a big plus key there was a minus and comma key. The top 4 keys were not math operators; rather they were PF-1 through PF-4. In order they were GOLD, HELP, Find, Delete Line. </p>
<p>Unlike a PC where you have to hold down <Ctrl> and another key, you simply press and release the GOLD key then press and release the key for the function you want. <b>The text that doesnâ€™t have a gold background is what they key does when the GOLD key was not pressed in front of it.</b></p>
<p>Because some EDT emulation modes on some editors, notably Emacs, are unable to map the NumLock key as GOLD, the Option dialog allows you to choose between NumLock and ScrollLock as your GOLD key.</p>
<p>EDT mode is direction maintaining. The default direction is Advance [the 4 key]. You can change the direction to Backup by hitting the 5 key. All of your navigation operations will continue in that direction until you change direction again.</p>
<br>
<h3>All you really need to know is HELP</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 30px
;">The PF2 key [/ on the PC keypad] brings up this Help text. Many a programmer learned EDT without access to a printed manual and before the Internet was even a dream. The Help screen had the keypad image you see here and just a few lines of text explaining a few cryptic things. We didn't have screen capture utilities on those green serial terminals, but some of them had an extra serial port for a printer. Many a developer used the magic terminal key combination to print the Help screen on an attached printer then hung it in their cubicle. This Help screen has far more information than we ever had.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">EDT became a favorite editor for tens of thousands of developers. It wasn't "expert friendly" like most of the editors then and now. All you needed was that screen print and someone telling you how to exit and save. All of the most used things were on the keypad. There were only a token few commands to execute at the command prompt and you didn't need them very often. You only had to know one: EXIT</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In general, just be aware that most of the "delete" functions can be undone using GOLD and the same key. The exception is DEL EOL which is discussed later.</p>
<br>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>LINE</b> [the 0 key] moves a line at a time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>WORD</b> [the 1 key] moves a word (determined by whitespace) at a time</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>EOL</b>  [the 2 key] moves to the directional end of line. In Backup mode this is the beginning</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>CHAR</b> [the 3 key] moves a character at a time</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>ADVANCE</b> [the 4 key] Sets the current editing direction forward which is the default at startup</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>BOTTOM</b> [GOLD ADVANCE] Takes you to end of file no matter what direction you have set.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>BACKUP</b> [the 5 key] Sets the current editing direction backwards towards the beginning of the file</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>TOP</b> [GOLD BACKUP] Takes you to top of file no matter what direction you have set.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>PAGE</b> [the 7 key] actually looks for a FormFeed character. SPECINS (short for special insert) is how you actually entered ASCII character numeric values. Developers printed on continuous form back then and we had to provide the page breaks in the source.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>SECT</b> [the 8 key] is what most closely equates to PC Page Up/Down. It moves 16 lines at a time.</p>
<br> 
<h3>Editing</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>DEL L</b> [PF4 - the minus key on the PC keypad] (Delete Line) Deletes from cursor THROUGH directional end of line removing the end of line character causing the text below to move up.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>DEL EOL</b> [GOLD 2 key] Deletes from where your cursor is to the directional End of Line. DOES NOT REMOVE THE EOL character(s)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>UND L</b> [GOLD PF4 - the minus key on the PC keypad] As weird as it may sound, both DEL L and DEL EOL used the same cut buffer. Using this UnDelete will paste the contents of whichever was last used where your cursor is currently located.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>DEL W</b> [default map <ALT>+ key on the PC keypad] The option screen lets you chose a different GOLD key mapping because this is the missing keypad key. Some developers use Delete Word all of the time and others (like myself) never do. Keep in mind that word deletion like most things honors the current editing direction</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>UND W</b> [GOLD DEL W] Pastes the last deleted word where your cursor is in a directionally sensitive manner.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>DEL C</b> [the + key on PC keypad] Deletes the character under your cursor and moves in the current editing direction.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>SELECT</b>[the . key on the PC keypad] Begins a selection area to be part of another operation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>RESET</b> [GOLD SELECT] Cancels current selection area.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>SPECINS</b> [GOLD CHAR] Prompts for a numeric character value which then gets inserted where the cursor is in the file. Traditionally this was a decimal value in the range 1-31 but this editor may support x and u prefixed values for Hex and Unicode. At least that is a planned enhancement. The most used value historically was 12 for ASCII FormFeed because that was used by the SECT key to identify the start of another section. Some scripts had need of ASCII 7 (Bell) and others needed ASCII 9 (hard horizontal tab).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>CUT</b> [the 6 key on the PC keypad] Once you have SELECTed an area you can CUT it into the paste buffer. On PCs this is typically also called the clipboard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>PASTE</b> [GOLD CUT] Pastes the current contents of the PASTE buffer where your cursor is.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>APPEND</b> [the 9 key on the PC keypad] Deletes the selected range of text and appends it to the paste buffer (clipboard)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>REPLACE</b> [GOLD APPEND] Deletes the currently selected text and replaces it with the test from the paste buffer (clipboard)</p>
