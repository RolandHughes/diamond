Description: This is the Diamond text editor.
 Diamond has been developed using the CopperSpice cross
 platform C++ libraries. It supports EDT keypad navigation,
 backups, color themes, and much more. You can configure a backup directory
 where you not only store a backup copy with each save
 and can control the maximum number of backups, but
 also the ability to list and view all backups for a given
 file. The Diamond Editor is open source and released under GPL V2.
